Also switched from StratifiedKFold to GroupKFold **[0.916]**\n","* v12: Switched to efficientnet-b1 **[0.919]**\n","* v13: Using meta featues: sex and age **[0.918]**\n","* v14: anatom_site_general_challenge meta feature added as one-hot encoded matrix **[0.923]**\n","* v16: Fixed OOF - now it contains only data from original training dataset, without extarnal data. Also switched back to StratifiedKFold. Added DrawHair augmentation. **[0.909]**\n","* v18: Too many things were changed at the same time. All experiments should have only one small change each, so it would be easy to understand how changes affect the result. Said that I rolled back everything, keeping only OOF fix, to make sure it work.\n","* v19: Added 'Hair' augmentation. OOF rework posponed untill the best time, since there is some bug in my code for it. **[0.925]**\n","* v20: Advanced Hair Augmentation technique used. Read more about it here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/discussion/159176 **[0.923]**\n","* v21: Microscope augmentation added instead of Cutout. Read more here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/discussion/159476 **[0.914]**\n","* v22: Changed the dataset to [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/jpeg-melanoma-256x256) by Chris Deotte. More info [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/discussion/165526) **[0.900]**\n","* v23: All the same as v22 but effnet-b0 instead of b1 and more epochs per fold. **[0.895]**\n","* v24: effnet-b01 and more epochs.\n","* v25: Fixed a mistake in a way of filling preds.
